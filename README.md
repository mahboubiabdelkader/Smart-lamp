# Smart-lamp
The Smart Lamp Control project is designed to create an innovative and user-friendly solution for remotely controlling a lamp using a Flutter mobile application and Bluetooth communication.
This project is perfect for those who want to enhance their home automation capabilities and learn about mobile app development and IoT (Internet of Things) integration.

Key Features:
1 Lamp Control: The core functionality of this project is to remotely turn the lamp on and off using a mobile app. This is achieved through a Bluetooth connection between the Flutter app and the lamp.

2 Flutter Mobile App: Develop a user-friendly Flutter application that allows users to control the lamp. The app should have a simple and intuitive user interface, first connect to the Bluetooth then you have the option  to turn the lamp on and off.

3 Bluetooth module: Utilize Bluetooth communication to establish a connection between the mobile app and the lamp. You can use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for power-efficient and reliable data transfer. but i used module hc-5 it's normal Bluetooth.

4 Arduino Microcontroller: The lamp can be controlled using an Arduino nano. The microcontroller should be programmed to receive data from the  from module hc-5 to  the Flutter app and control the lamp accordingly.
